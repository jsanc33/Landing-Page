A simple landing page built for Module 01 of the FSF Bootcamp. This project demonstrates basic HTML structure and CSS styling to create a responsive and accessible user interface for collecting visitor contact information.

## Description

This project is a single-page application designed to serve as a landing page. It includes a header, a footer, an image with a caption, and a contact form. The primary goal is to showcase fundamental web development skills using HTML and CSS, fulfilling the requirements of the Module 01 Mini-Project.

## Features

Based on the project acceptance criteria:

*   Semantic HTML elements for clear structure.
*   CSS styling using universal, element, and class selectors.
*   A design incorporating at least three distinct colors.
*   Consistent typography with a single font and font family for all text.
*   Use of at least two different heading elements (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`).
*   A header fixed to the top of the page, remaining visible on scroll.
*   A navigation bar within the header containing three inline links, including a "Contact" link.
*   The "Contact" link smoothly navigates the page to the contact form section.
*   A contact form with `input` elements for capturing the visitor's name and email address.
*   A functional "Send" button within the contact form.
*   The main image includes a descriptive `alt` attribute for accessibility.
*   The completed page is deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages.
